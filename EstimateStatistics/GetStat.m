function [Cxx, Cxy] = GetStat(sampled_spikes,stat)
% inputs:
% sampled_spikes - observed spikes
% outputs:
% Cxx  - NxN matrix of estimated spike covariance at a single timestep
% Cxy - NxN matrix of estimated spike cross-covariance  between two adjacent timesteps
% stat - struct with various parameters (add details later)

% Write this

end
